Winner of New Mexico Tech cybersecurity game jam (2019).

This game simulates a small office environment where you (the cybersecurity proffesional) are responsible for addresssing your coworkers cybersecurity needs and stopping problems such as viruses and worms before they get out of hand. This game is meant as an educational tool to teach the basics of cybersecurity. It involves multiple types of attacks including DOS, viruses, and phishing.

The game was selected to be further developed for use in educational environments but due to the covid outbreak and demanding courseload, the project was discontinued.
